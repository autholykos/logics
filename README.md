# Logic Version Control Installer

This program helps in installing the necessary tools for starting up and maintaining a Logic project fully available to a distributed team of musicians, sound engineers and composers. Its focus is simplicity and avoiding collaborators within a Logic project to having to toss around audio tracks and other deliverables.

## Prerequisite

* MacOSX: from Mojave up
* git (minimum version 2.0): version control system used by this program
* Dropbox shared folder: the project relies on Dropbox as "remote" storage where the git repositories are stored, which needs to be made available to the program in order to function properly.

## Dependencies

The program will download and install the following programs on the local system:
* git-lfs: git support for large file system
* lfs-folderstore: shared folder agent for git-lfs
